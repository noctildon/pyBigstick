# pyBigstick

A python script that generates the input for [BIGSTICK](https://github.com/cwjsdsu/BigstickPublick), which uses shell model (theory & algorithm) and fortran (implementation) to calculate the nuclear structure.

See main.py for the example code, and show.py for data visualization (using streamlit).
